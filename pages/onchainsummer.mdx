```ts
const getIrys = async () => {
	const network = "mainnet";
	// Devnet RPC URLs change often, use a recent one from https://chainlist.org/
	const providerUrl = "";
	const token = "base-eth";

	const irys = new Irys({
		network, // "mainnet" or "devnet"
		token, // Token used for payment
		key: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // ETH or SOL private key
		config: { providerUrl }, // Optional provider URL, only required when using Devnet
	});
	return irys;
};
```

```ts
const getWebIrys = async () => {
	// Ethers5 provider
	(await window.base) - eth.enable();
	const provider = new providers.Web3Provider(window.base - eth);

	const network = "mainnet";
	const token = "base-eth";
	// Devnet RPC URLs change often, use a recent one from https://chainlist.org
	const rpcUrl = "";

	// Create a wallet object
	const wallet = { rpcUrl: rpcUrl, name: "ethersv5", provider: provider };
	// Use the wallet object
	const webIrys = new WebIrys({ network, token, wallet });
	await webIrys.ready();

	return webIrys;
};
```

```ts
const uploadData = async () => {
