## About Bundlr

Bundlr makes web3 data storage on Arweave accessible by making it as fast, easy, and reliable as traditional data storage. Arweave is the only truly decentralized, permanent data storage solution. Bundlr increases the amount of transactions conducted on Arweave by 4000% without sacrificing security or usability, and is around ~3000x faster at uploading data.

Bundlr currently accounts for over 90% of data uploaded to Arweave. It enables infinite scalability and enables instant and guaranteed transaction finality. It is a multi-chain solution and is compatible with leading blockchains including Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, Polygon, and many more.

## How does Bundlr work?

Bundlr comprises nodes (known as bundlers), which are used to bundle multiple layer 2 transactions into a single Arweave (layer 1) transaction. When a user uploads data to Bundlr, it will take that data, as well as other data uploads and stick them together into a bundle. It will collect data for two minutes before submitting the bundle onto Arweave. It continues to do this over and over again, bundling data for two minutes, and submitting it onto Arweave.

Bundlr pays for these transactions with Arweaveâ€™s native token, AR. Bundlr holds a treasury for AR tokens to ensure that there are enough funds to continue uploading these bundles. Since Bundlr pays for the data uploaded to Arweave with AR, the user does not need AR tokens. Bundlr can accept any token as payment, including ETH, SOL, MATIC, DOT, and many others. When using Bundlr, the user can use these native tokens to pay for data uploads.

Bundlr also allows users to sign with their native keys. You can sign for the transaction with any key type, such as Ethereum and Solana, when you use Bundlr.

## How does the validator network work?

When a user uploads data to Bundlr, they receive a receipt that promises that their transaction will be uploaded to Arweave within a few hours. That receipt is signed by three validators, which signals that they are all aware of the transaction and will ensure that it will move from Bundlr to Arweave.

Now that the three validators are tracking the transaction, they will wait for it to move from Bundlr, onto Arweave. When the data is uploaded to Arweave, the validators will confirm that the transaction has been completed.

The validators are incentivized to complete transactions as they receive a profit margin from each transaction it completes. There are three validators per data upload from Bundlr to Arweave, and only one needs to confirm that the transaction has been completed.

## What is web3 data storage on Arweave?

Web3 data storage on Arweave is decentralized and permanent. It is the only data chain that offers this solution.

When data is uploaded, the nodes are incentivized to store the data permanently, so there is never a risk of it being deleted. Since your data is stored across multiple nodes, even if one of the nodes is destroyed or dropped from the network, the remaining nodes ensure that your data is still accessible. This means that your data is highly resistant to deletion, corruption, and censorship.

Because the network is decentralized means that the data is not stored in one central location, where it is significantly more resilient to hacks and malicious attacks. Outages are extremely rare since they are generally caused by physical altercations with centralized servers such as power outages. Additionally, the data is not owned by a single entity, therefore there is no singular body that can change the data or block you from accessing it. The data is stored forever so you will never lose it.

Permanent, decentralized storage is the only way to preserve data securely, and Bundlr makes it faster, reliable, and easier to use.
