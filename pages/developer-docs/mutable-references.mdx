# Mutable references

Mutable references enable the creation of a single, static URL that is linked to a sequential series of transactions. You can add a new transaction to the series at any time, and the URL will always resolve to the most recent transaction.

To create a mutable reference:

1. Upload a base transaction to Irys and reference it using a URL in the following format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/:id`

```js
const irys = await getIrys();
const receiptOne = await irys.upload("First TX");
console.log(`TX 1 uploaded https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/${receiptOne.id}`);
```

2. Upload an addition to the series as a new transaction, and add a tag named `Root-TX` with the value of the original transaction ID.

```js
const tags = [{ name: "Root-TX", value: receiptOne.id }];
const receiptTwo = await irys.upload("Second TX", { tags });
console.log(`TX 2 uploaded https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/${receiptOne.id}`);
```

The original URL (https://gateway.irys.xyz/mutable/:id) now resolves to the second transaction in the chain.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	When building a transaction chain, additions must be made using the same wallet that created the original
	transaction. This prevents unauthorized actors from maliciously modifying someone else’s transaction chain.

## Granularity

Mutable references are based on Irys’ millisecond-accurate timestamps. You can publish multiple sequential updates to a given transaction and be confident the transaction served by the `/mutable/` endpoint will always be the most recent chronological one.

## Use-cases

-   Irys’ mutable references open up new opportunities for builders, including:
-   Gaming NFTs: Metadata changes based on in-game actions
-   Dynamic NFTs: Images change based on onchain activity
-   Software distribution: The latest version is always available via the same link
-   Content publishing / social media: Content can be updated at any time and users will always have the most recent version
-   Website hosting / dApp front-ends: Websites can be updated at any time without changing the main URL
