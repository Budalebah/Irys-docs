# Irys In The Browser (WebIrys)

Working with Irys in the browser is similar to working with our server-side SDK, however there are a few differences which are demonstrated below.

In addition to creating your own components using the code below, you can also fork the [Irys provenance
toolkit](/developer-docs/provenance-toolkit) and quickly build your project using its rich UI component library and
helper functions.

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€">
	If you're using Bundlr with React and `npx create-react-app`, you will need to [follow some extra setup
	steps](https://docs.bundlr.network/hands-on/tutorials/react).
</Callout>

## Installing

Install using npm:

```console
npm install @irys/client
```

or yarn:

```console
yarn add @irys/client
```

## Importing

```js
import Irys from "@irys/sdk";
```

## Connecting to a node

When instantiating a `WebIrys` object pass:

-   `url`: Irys [node address](/overview/nodes)
-   `token`: Payment [token](/overview/supported-tokens)
-   `wallet`: A wallet object containing the end-user's injected provider and the name of the provider package your project uses

```js
const getWebIrys = async () => {
	// Ethers5 provider
	await (window as WindowWithEthereum).ethereum.enable();
	const provider = new providers.Web3Provider((window as WindowWithEthereum).ethereum);

	const url = "https://node1.irys.xyz"
	const token = "matic";
	const rpcURL = "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com"; // Optional parameter

	// Create a wallet object
	const wallet = { rpcUrl: rpcURL, name: "ethersv5", provider: provider };
	// Use the wallet object
	const webIrys = new WebIrys({ url, token, wallet });
	await webIrys.ready();

	return webIrys;
};

```

After instantiating the object, call `webIrys.ready()`.

### Supported providers

WebIrys supports the following providers. When instantiating a new `WebIrys` object, you must pass in the name of the provider you will be using.

| Package                                        | Parameter value |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| [ Ethers 5 ](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)      | ethersv5        |
| [ Ethers 6 ](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/)      | ethersv6        |
| [ Rainbowkit v1 ](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) | rainbowkitv1    |
| [ Viem v1 ](https://viem.sh/)                  | viemv1          |

## Funding a node

Fund a node using any of our [supported tokens](/overview/supported-tokens):

```js
const fundNode = async () => {
	const webIrys = await getWebIrys();
	try {
		const fundTx = await webIrys.fund(webIrys.utils.toAtomic(0.05));
		console.log(`Successfully funded ${webIrys.utils.fromAtomic(fundTx.quantity)} ${webIrys.token}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
	}
};
```

## Uploading

The [provenance toolkit contains an uploader component](/developer-docs/provenance-toolkit/uploader) that can be dropped into any project to instantly enable file uploading.

Data uploaded to Irys is given a millisecond-accurate timestamp, attributes and authorship details before being passed to Arweave for permanent storage. This information is used to create a signed [receipt](/learn/receipts) that can be used to [verify](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/api/utils-verifyReceipt) the data's provenance at any time.

### Uploading data

```js
const uploadData = async () => {
	const webIrys = await getWebIrys();
	const dataToUpload = "GM world.";
	try {
		const receipt = await webIrys.upload(dataToUpload);
		console.log(`Data uploaded ==> https://arweave.net/${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
	}
};
```

### Uploading a file

Upload a [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) object.

```js
const uploadFile = async (fileToUpload) => {
	const webirys = await getWebIrys();
	// Your file
	const tags = [{ name: "application-id", value: "MyNFTDrop" }];

	try {
		const receipt = await webIrys.uploadFile(fileToUpload, { tags });
		console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://arweave.net/${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
	}
};
```

### Uploading a folder

Upload an array of [File](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) objects.

Upon upload, a manifest is automatically created. Your files can be accessed `https://arweave.net/[manifestId]/[file-name]`.

```js
const uploadFolder = async (files: File[], tags: Tag[]) => {
	const irys = await getIrys();

	try {
		const receipt = await irys.uploadFolder(files, {
			tags,
		}); //returns the manifest ID

		console.log(`Files uploaded. Manifest Id=${receipt.manifestId} Receipt Id=${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
	}
};
```
