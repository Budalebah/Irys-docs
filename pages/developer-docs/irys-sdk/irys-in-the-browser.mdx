# Irys In The Browser (WebIrys)

<Callout emoji="ðŸš€">
	When building with Irys in the browser, the easiest way to get started is by forking the [Irys provenance
	toolkit](/developer-docs/provenance-toolkit) and building your project using its rich UI component library and
	helper functions.
</Callout>

Working with Irys in the browser is similar to working with our server-side SDK, however there are a few differences which demonstrated below.

## Installing

## Installing

Install using npm:

```console
npm install @irys/client
```

or yarn:

```console
yarn add @irys/client
```

## Importing

```js
import Irys from "@irys/client";
```

## Connecting to a node

When instantiating a `WebIrys` object pass:

-   `url`: Irys [node address](/overview/nodes)
-   `token`: Payment [token](/overview/supported-tokens)
-   `providerName`: The provider package your project uses

```js
const getWebIrys = async () => {
	// Ethers5 provider
	await (window as WindowWithEthereum).ethereum.enable();
	const provider = new providers.Web3Provider((window as WindowWithEthereum).ethereum);

	const url = "https://node1.irys.xyz"
	const token = "matic";
	const providerName = "ethersv5";
	const webIrys = new WebIrys({ url, token, provider, providerName });
	await webIrys.ready(); // Always call after instantiating
	return webIrys;
};

```

After instantiating the object, call `webIrys.ready()`.

## Supported providers

WebIrys supports the following providers. When instantiating a new `WebIrys` object, you must pass in the name of the provider you will be using.

| Package                                        | `providerName` value |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| [ Ethers 5 ](https://docs.ethers.org/v5/)      | ethersv5             |
| [ Ethers 6 ](https://docs.ethers.org/v6/)      | ethersv6             |
| [ Rainbowkit v1 ](https://www.rainbowkit.com/) | rainbowkitv1         |
| [ Viem v1 ](https://viem.sh/)                  | viemv1               |

## Funding a node

Fund a node using any of our supported tokens:

```js
const fundNode = async () => {
	const webIrys = await getWebIrys();
	try {
		const fundTx = await webIrys.fund(webIrys.utils.toAtomic(0.05));
		console.log(`Successfully funded ${webIrys.utils.fromAtomic(fundTx.quantity)} ${webIrys.token}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
	}
};
```

## Uploading

## Uploading a folder

and then you can [fund your node](/developer-docs/irys-sdk#funding-a-node) and permanently upload data.

	If you're using Bundlr with React and `npx create-react-app`, you will need to [follow some extra setup
	steps](https://docs.bundlr.network/hands-on/tutorials/react).
