# Migration Guide

Migrating your application from the Bundlr SDK to the Irys SDK is a simple process.

## Installation

Install the Irys SDK using npm

```console
npm install @irys/client
```

or yarn.

```console
yarn add @irys/client
```

TODO: Update install instructions once final

## Imports

Change your import statements from:

```js
import Bundlr from "@bundlr-network/client";
```

to:

```js
import Irys from "@irys/client";
```

## Constructor

In the Bundlr SDK, parameters are passed directly. In the Irys SDK, parameters are passed inside an options object.

Update `new Bundlr` to `new Irys` and then wrap your constructor arguments in `{}`.

```js
const url = "https://devnet.bundlr.network";
const providerUrl = "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com";
const token = "matic";

const bundlr = new Bundlr(url, token, process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY);

const irys = new Irys({
	url, // URL of the node you want to connect to
	token, // Token used to pay for uploads
	key: process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY, // ETH or SOL private key
	config: { providerUrl }, // Optional provider URL, only required when using Devnet
});
```

## Changes to upload functions

In the Bundlr SDK, there were separate functions for uploading data and uploading data and getting a receipt.

With the Irys SDK, all upload functions now return [a cryptographically signed receipt](/learn/receipts).

The

`bundlr.uploadWithReceipt()` was used for strong provenance uploads.

The following functions used for permanent storage uploads have not changed, as long as you properly instantiate the `Irys` object, your previous upload code will work as before.

-   [`irys.upload()`](./api/upload) To upload any data
-   [`irys.uploadFile()`](./api/uploadFile) To upload a file
-   [`irys.uploadFolder()`](./api/uploadFolder) To upload a folder

## Strong Provenance Uploads

The Irys SDK introduces three new functions for this purpose, all residing under the `irys.provenance` namespace, and sharing identical signatures with the permanent storage upload functions.

-   [`irys.provenance.upload()`](./api/provenance-upload) To upload any data
-   [`irys.provenance.uploadFile()`](./api/provenance-uploadFile) To upload a file
-   [`irys.provenance.uploadFolder()`](./api/provenance-uploadFolder) To upload a folder
