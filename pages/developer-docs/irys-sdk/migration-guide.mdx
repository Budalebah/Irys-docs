# Migration guide

Migrating your application from the Bundlr SDK to the Irys SDK is a simple process.

## Installation

Install the Irys SDK using npm:

```console
npm install @irys/client
```

or yarn:

```console
yarn add @irys/client
```

## Imports

Change your import statements from:

```js
import Bundlr from "@bundlr-network/client";
```

to:

```js
import Irys from "@irys/client";
```

## Constructor

In the Bundlr SDK, parameters are passed directly. In the Irys SDK, parameters are passed inside an options object.

Update `new Bundlr` to `new Irys` and then wrap your constructor arguments in `{}`.

```js
const url = "https://devnet.irys.xyz";
const providerUrl = "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com";
const token = "matic";

const bundlr = new Bundlr(url, token, process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY);

const irys = new Irys({
	url, // URL of the node you want to connect to
	token, // Token used to pay for uploads
	key: process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY, // ETH or SOL private key
	config: { providerUrl }, // Optional provider URL, only required when using Devnet
});
```

## Changes to upload functions

In the Bundlr SDK there were separate upload functions depending on whether you wanted a receipt or not. With the Irys SDK, all upload functions return a [receipt](/learn/receipts).

The following function is removed:

-   `bundlr.uploadWithReceipt()`

The following functions upload data as before however, the return type has changed to be a receipt.

-   [`irys.upload()`](./api/upload) To upload any data
-   [`irys.uploadFile()`](./api/uploadFile) To upload a file
-   [`irys.uploadFolder()`](./api/uploadFolder) To upload a folder

## Change to WebBundlr / WebIrys
