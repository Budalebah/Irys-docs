# Balance approvals

Balance approvals allow for the sharing of balances between multiple addresses. Use balance approvals to pay for your users' uploads while still allowing those users to sign the transactions themselves.

Balance approvals:

- Are based on the token set when connecting to an Irys node. Both approver and approvee must use the same
  token.
- Are registered instantly upon upload completion.
- Are non-transferable.
- Can be configured to expire automatically.

## Create an approval

```ts
const approvalReceipt = await irys.approval.createApproval({
	amount: irys.utils.toAtomic(1), // Amount in atomic units
	approvedAddress: "",
	expiresInSeconds: 100, // Expires in 100 seconds. Delete to remove expiration.
});
```

## Upload using an approval

```ts
const approvedReceipt = await irys.upload("GM World", { upload: { paidBy: "payerAddress" } });
```

## Revoke an approval

```ts
const revocationReceipt = await irys.approval.revokeApproval({ approvedAddress: "address" });
```

## Get balances the connected Irys account is approved for

```ts
const approvals = await irys.approval.getApprovals({
	payingAddresses: [],
});
```

Return type:

```ts
{
	amount: string; // Amount approved in atomic units
	payingAddress: string; // Address of the payer's wallet
	approvedAddress: string; // Address of the wallet that received the approval
	expiresBy: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when approval expires
	timestamp: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when the approval was created
	token: string; // Approved token
}
[];
```

## Get balances the connected Irys account has created

```ts
const createdApprovals = irys.approval.getCreatedApprovals({
	approvedAddresses: [],
});
```

Return type:

```ts
{
	amount: string; // Amount approved in atomic units
	payingAddress: string; // Address of the payer's wallet
	approvedAddress: string; // Address of the wallet that received the approval
	expiresBy: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when approval expires
	timestamp: number; // Timestamp (in milliseconds) when the approval was created
	token: string; // Approved token
}
[];
```

## Get balance approvals via HTTP

You can also request balance approvals from our HTTP endpoint:

Devnet:

```
https://arweave.devnet.irys.xyz/account/approval?payingAddress=<...>&token=<...>&approvedAddress=<...>
```

Mainnet:

```
https://arweave.mainnet.irys.xyz/account/approval?payingAddress=<...>&token=<...>&approvedAddress=<...>
```
