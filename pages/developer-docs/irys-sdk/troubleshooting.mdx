# Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting common errors during installation and use.

Errors:

-   [bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/troubleshooting#bigint)
-   [Error: Using devnet.irys.xyz requires a dev/testnet RPC to be configured](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/troubleshooting#devnet-rpc)
-   [Error: Not enough balance for transaction](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/troubleshooting#insufficient-balance)

## bigint

**Error message:** bigint: Failed to load bindings, pure JS will be used (try npm run rebuild?)

This error can be safely ignored, it will not cause any issues. To make the error go away, you'll need to install updated Python and C++ build tools.

**MacOS**

Current versions of MacOS come pre-built with Python. To install the C++ build tools:

-   First install [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/)
-   Once XCode is installed, go to Preferences, Downloads, and install the Command Line Tools

**Windows**

Windows users need to install both Python and C++ build tools. These commands must be run with administrator permissions.

```console
// First run:
npm i -g --add-python-to-path --vs2015 --production windows-build-tools

// Then run:
npm i -g node-gyp@latest
```

**UNIX**

Most UNIX distributions come with Python installed, to install C++ build tools use the following:

```console
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Devnet RPC

**Error message**: Error: Using devnet.irys.xyz requires a dev/testnet RPC to be configured

When using our [Devnet](/developer-docs/using-devnet), you must provide the URL to a Denvet RPC for the chain you're using. As this parameter is not required when using Node 1 and 2, users will sometimes get an error if they forget to add in the RPC URL.

For example, this will throw an error

```js
const getIrys = async () => {
	const url = "https://devnet.irys.xyz";
	const token = "matic";

	const irys = new Irys({
		url, // URL of the node you want to connect to
		token, // Token used for payment
		key: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // EVM private key
	});
	return irys;
};
```

But this will not:

```js
const getIrys = async () => {
	const url = "https://devnet.irys.xyz";
	const token = "matic";
	const providerUrl = "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com";

	const irys = new Irys({
		url, // URL of the node you want to connect to
		token, // Token used for payment
		key: process.env.EVM_PRIVATE_KEY, // EVM private key
		config: { providerUrl }, // Optional provider URL, only required when using Devnet
	});
	return irys;
};
```

As RPC URLs change frequently, users should always choose an up-to-date one from [https://chainlist.org/](https://chainlist.org/)

## Insufficient balance

**Error message**: Error: Not enough balance for transaction

This error occurs when you try to upload to a node without first funding it. This applies to both Nodes 1 and 2 where you can pay using any our supported [mainnet tokens](/overview/supported-tokens#mainnet-tokens) and our Devnet node where you can pay using any of our supported [Devnet tokens](/overview/supported-tokens#devnet-tokens).

Devnet tokens can be obtained for free from common faucets like the ones for [Solana](https://faucet.solana.com/), [Sepolia](https://sepoliafaucet.com/) and [Mumbai](https://mumbaifaucet.com/).
