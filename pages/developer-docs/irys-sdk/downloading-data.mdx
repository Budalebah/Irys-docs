# Downloading Data

The transaction id returned from uploading data is used to generate an URL you can use to then view or download the data. The format used is `https://arweave.net/[transaction-id]`. For example https://arweave.net/CO9EpX0lekJEfXUOeXncUmMuG8eEp5WJHXl9U9yZUYA.

Alternatively, you can download data uploaded via Irys using our gateway; the URL format is the same `https://gateway.irys.xyz/[transaction-id]`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The Irys gateway only returns data stored on Arweave uploaded via Irys, it will not return data uploaded directly to
	Arweave.
