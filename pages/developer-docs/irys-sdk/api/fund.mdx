# `irys.fund(amount)`

Funds the [Irys node](/developer-docs/nodes) you connected to with the specified amount of tokens. Fund the node you intend to upload to, funded balances are not shared between nodes.

**Parameters**

<div className="-mt-6" />
- `amount`: The amount to fund. Value should be [in atomic
units](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/api/utils-toAtomic).

**Returns**

<div className="-mt-6" />
- `response`: A JSON object with the following values

```json
response = {
	id, // The transaction id of the fund transfer
	quantity, // How much is being transferred
	reward, // The amount taken by the network as a fee
	target, // The address the funds were sent to
};
```

## Upfront Funding

You can up-front fund a node, where you send over enough funds to cover all of a project’s uploads. When upfront funding, you may want to [write a script to monitor your stored balance, topping up when needed.](TODO)

```js
try {
	const fundTx = await irys.fund(irys.utils.toAtomic(0.05));
	console.log(`Successfully funded ${irys.utils.fromAtomic(fundTx.quantity)} ${irys.token}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error funding node ", e);
}
```

## Lazy-Funding

You can also lazy-fund a node where you check the cost to upload each file first and then transfer exact funds. This works best with currencies like MATIC, ETH and SOL whose balances post (almost) instantly.

```js
const pathToFile = "./llama.png";
const { size } = await fs.promises.stat(pathToFile);
const price = await irys.getPrice(size);
await irys.fund(price);

const { id } = await irys.uploadFile(pathToFile);
console.log(`${pathToFile} --> Uploaded to https://arweave.net/${id}`);
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
Not all calls to `irys.fund()` will post immediately to your account, some blockchains are faster than others. When funding with AR, it can take upwards of 40 minutes before the balance post. For MATIC, ETH and SOL, balances will usually post in < 10s.
