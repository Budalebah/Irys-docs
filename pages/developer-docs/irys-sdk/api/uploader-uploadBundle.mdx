# `upload.uploadBundle(tx)`

[Permanently](/overview/permanent-data) uploads an array of transactions as a bundle. This function is provided for users.

This function is provided for users who need to obtain the each transaction's ID before uploading. Most users will opt to use [`irys.uploadFolder()`](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/api/uploadFolder), an abstraction that handles the uploading, signing and bundling in a single function call. 


**Parameters**

<div className="-mt-6" />

-   `data`: The data to upload
-   `tags`: Optional [metatags](/developer-docs/tags)

**Returns**

<div className="-mt-6" />- `receipt`: A [receipt](/learn/receipts) in the form of a JSON object with the following values:

```json
response = {
	id, // Transaction id (used to download the data)
	timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
	version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
	public, // Public key of the bundler node used
	signature, // A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt
	deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized on Arweave
	block, // Deprecated
	validatorSignatures, // Deprecated
	verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```
**Example**
```js
const irys = await getIrys();

const dataToUpload = "GM world.";
try {
	const receipt = await irys.upload(dataToUpload);
	console.log(`Data uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${receipt.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The transaction id returned as part of the response is used to download the data, simply create a URL with the
	format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/[transaction-id].`
</Callout>
