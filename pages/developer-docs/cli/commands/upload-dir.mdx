# `upload-dir`

Uploads an entire directory of files.

**Required Parameters**

<div className="-mt-6" />

-   `-h`: The you'll node upload to
-   `-t`: The [token](/overview/supported-tokens) to use when uploading.
-   `-w`: Your [private key](/developer-docs/cli#private-keys-for-funding-and-signing).

## Example

```console
irys upload-dir ./myImages -h https://node1.irys.xyz -t matic -w bf20......c9885307
```

Append the optional `--provenance` flag for a [strong provenance](/learn/strong-provenance) upload.

```console
irys upload-dir ./myImages --provenance -h https://node1.irys.xyz -t matic -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Downloading Files

Files uploaded via `irys upload-dir` can be retrieved in one of two ways.

1. Creating an URL with the format `https://arweave.net/[manifest-id]/[original-file-name]`.
2. Creating an URL using the transaction ID of each individual file uploaded with the format `https://arweave.net/[transacton-id]`

After a successful folder upload, two files are written to your local project directory `[folder_name].csv` and `[folder_name].json`. The example below highlights a folder called “llama_folder” with a total of 5 files in it. The transaction id for each file can be used to retrieve the uploaded data by forming an URL with the format `https://arweave.net]/[transaction-id]`
