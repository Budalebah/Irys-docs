The Bundlr Provenance Toolkit is a collection of UI components you can use to rapidly develop dApps with features including strong provenance and permanent data. It contains UI components for funding nodes, uploading files, performing gassless uploads, and querying transactions.

The toolkit is fully opensource, you are welcome to use it any way you want with or without attribution.

## Prerequisites

The Provenance Toolkit is designed for intermediate to advanced developers and assumes you have a working knowledge of NextJS, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Beginning developers may want to start with our [tutorials](/hands-on/tutorials) and [quests](/hands-on/quests) which are designed for a broader audience.

This guide gives an introduction to the entire toolkit, including how to use and customize the components. To learn more about how each component is built, we have separate tutorials for each.

## Setup

1. Fork or clone https://github.com/Bundlr-Network/provenance-toolkit
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn` from within the project directory
3. Rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and follow the configuration instructions in that file
4. Run `npm run start` from within the project directory
5. Launch the Provenance Toolkit at http://localhost:3000/

The project is broken into three main categories:

-   Components: The UI components. These can be imported into your projects and used as is.
-   Navigation routes: NextJS navigation routing. If you’re building your own project on top of the Provenance Toolkit, you can delete these routes and create your own.
-   Utils: Utility functions used by the UI components.

## Components

Included within the Provenance Toolkit are the following components. The components are each linked to guides teaching how each is built.

-   [Fund / Withdraw](./provenance-toolkit/fund-withdraw): Fund nodes and withdraw excess funds.
-   [Uploader](./provenance-toolkit/uploder): Upload single files or groups of files.
-   [Progress Bar Uploader](./provenance-toolkit/progress-bar-uploader): Upload large files, and provide feedback with a progress bar.
-   [UDL Uploader](./provenance-toolkit/udl-uploader): Upload files and attach a UDL.
-   [Gasless Uploader](<(./provenance-toolkit/gassless-uploader)>): Pay for user uploads server-side.
-   [Transaction Feed](./provenance-toolkit/transaction-feed): Query Bundlr nodes for transactions that meet your criteria.

## Customization

The components are designed with a minimal UI that can be easily incorporated into any design.

To change colors, modify the values in `tailwind.config.js`.

## Utility Functions

The following utility functions are used internally by the components. If you're using the components as-is, you can safely ignore the utility functions. For users customizing the components, these functions provide an additional abstraction layer over our SDK.

-   `titleCase.ts`: Converts a string to title case
-   `getRpcUrl.ts`: Returns the RPC URL for the chain associated with the specified currency.
-   `getBundlr.ts`: Instantiates a Bundlr object using the parameters in `.env.local`. Currently designed to work with the Ethers 6 provider, to use a different provider, use code from here.
-   `fundAndUpload.ts`: Using the browser’s injected provider, determines the upload cost for the specified data, funds the node if needed or skips the if the node has sufficient balance, and then uploads the file.
-   `gasslessFundAndUpload.ts`: Using the private key supplied in `.env.local`, determines the upload cost for the specified data, funds the node if needed or skips the if the node has sufficient balance, and then uploads the file.
-   `queryGraphQL.ts`: Builds and executes a Bundlr GraphQL query using the specified parameters.
