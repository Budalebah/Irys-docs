# Querying & Downloading

When a transaction is uploaded to Bundlr, its header and data are stored separately (as explained in [transaction lifecycle](/learn/transaction-lifecycle)).

Contained within the header is the transaction metadata, this is available for querying via a REST API and [GraphQL](/developer-docs/recipes/graphql).

Data is available for downloading via [gateways](/learn/gateways).

## Querying Metadata

Bundlr supports adding custom metadata tags to each upload, these tags allow users to build semi-relational data models, all queryable via [GraphQL](/developer-docs/recipes/graphql).

Tags can be used to:

-   Categorize transactions, making it easier to search for and retrieve relevant information using GraphQL
-   Build provenance chains for [Proof Of Provenance](/overview/solutions/proof-of-provenance) applications
-   Inform web browsers how to render image files

## Downloading Data

The transaction id returned when uploading data is used to generate an URL you can use to download the data.

The format used is `https://arweave.net/[transaction_id]`. For example `https://arweave.net/CO9EpX0lekJEfXUOeXncUmMuG8eEp5WJHXl9U9yZUYA`.
