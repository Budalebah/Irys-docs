# Quickstart

Install our SDK and upload data to the permaweb in just a few steps. For full details on each function see our [SDK documentation](/developer-docs/sdk).

### Prerequisites

To install our SDK, make sure you have a [current version of node](https://nodejs.org/en) installed first.

We also have a [detailed step-by-step tutorial](/hands-on/tutorials/bundlr-sdk) covering this same material.

</Callout>

#### Step 1: [Install the SDK](/developer-docs/sdk/installing-the-sdk)

```console
npm install @bundlr-network/client
```

or

```console
yarn add @bundlr-network/client
```

#### Step 2: [Connect To A Bundlr Node](/developer-docs/sdk/connecting-node)

```js
const polygonPrivateKey = "6d779d4..."; // your private key
const bundlr = new Bundlr("http://node2.bundlr.network", "matic", polygonPrivateKey);
```

#### Step 3: [Fund Your Node](/developer-docs/sdk/funding-node) (To Pay For Uploads)

```js
const response = await bundlr.fund(fundAmount);
```

#### Step 4: [Upload Data](/developer-docs/sdk/uploading-data)

```js
const dataToUpload = "GM world.";
const response = await bundlr.upload(dataToUpload);
```

#### Step 5: [Download Your Data](/developer-docs/sdk/downloading-data)

```js
console.log(`Data Available at => https://arweave.net/${response.id}`);
```
