# Node merge

On March 27th, 2024, Irys merged its two mainnet nodes.

This change is fully backward compatible. You can continue using existing versions of our tools with no changes.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Uploads of less than 100 KiB will remain free on Mainnet and Devnet.
</Callout>

## Balances

User balances on nodes 1 and 2 have been merged into a single mainnet balance.

## Node URLs

Most users will not need the direct node URLs as the SDK abstracts this away. However, if needed, you can use the following:

- `https://arweave.mainnet.irys.xyz`
- `https://arweave.devnet.irys.xyz`

## Upgrading

To upgrade your code, see below:

- [SDK](#sdk)
- [CLI](#cli)
- [Query package](#query-package)
- [GraphQL](#graphql)
- [Provenance Toolkit](#provenance-toolkit)
- [Whistleblower](#whistleblower)

## SDK

Previously, you specified the node's URL to connect to our SDK.

```ts
const irys = new Irys({
	url: "https://node2.irys.xyz", // URL of the node you want to connect to
	token, // Token used for payment
	key: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // Private key
});
```

Now, you can pass either `"mainnet"` or `"devnet"` as a network parameter to the SDK.

```ts
const irys = new Irys({
	network: "mainnet", // "mainnet" or "devnet"
	token, // Token used for payment
	key: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // Private key
});
```

## CLI

Previously, you specified the node's URL using the `-h` flag.

```console
irys fund 1000000000000000 \
  -h https://node1.irys.xyz \
  -t matic \
  -w bf20......c9885307
```

Now, you specify either `mainnet` or `devnet` using the `-n` flag.

```console
irys fund 1000000000000000 \
  -n mainnet \
  -t matic \
  -w bf20......c9885307
```

## Query package

Previously, you set the query location using the `url` parameter.

```ts
const myQuery = new Query({ url: "https://devnet.irys.xyz/graphql" });
```

Now, you set the query location using the `network` parameter.

```ts
const myQuery = new Query({ network: "mainnet" }); // "mainnet" || "devnet" || "arweave"
```

Previously, when querying directly from the SDK, you used the `url()` method to specify a search location. This method has been depercated.

```js
const result = await irys
	.search("irys:transactions")
	.url("https://node1.irys.xyz/graphql")
	.token("matic")
	.fromTimestamp(new Date("2023-07-01"))
	.toTimestamp(new Date("2023-07-03"));
```

And the `network()` method has been added.

```js
const result = await irys
	.search("irys:transactions")
	.network("mainnet") // "mainnet" || "devnet"
	.token("matic")
	.fromTimestamp(new Date("2023-07-01"))
	.toTimestamp(new Date("2023-07-03"));
```

## GraphQL

Previously, we had separate URLs for our two mainnet nodes.

| Node   | Endpoint                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Node 1 | https://node1.irys.xyz/graphql  |
| Node 2 | https://node2.irys.xyz/graphql  |
| Devnet | https://devnet.irys.xyz/graphql |

Now, we use a unified URL.

| Node    | Endpoint                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Mainnet | https://arweave.mainnet.irys.xyz/graphql |
| Devnet  | https://arweave.devnet.irys.xyz/graphql  |

## Provenance Toolkit

The [Provenance Toolkit](/developer-docs/provenance-toolkit) has been updated to use our unified nodes.

## Whistleblower

Previously, you used a flag to tell Whistleblower which mainnet nodes to monitor.

```console
yarn whistleblower init --nodes https://node1.irys.xyz https://node2.irys.xyz
yarn start
```

```console
npm run whistleblower init  -- --nodes https://node1.irys.xyz https://node2.irys.xyz
npm run start
```

Now, you no longer need to.

```console
yarn whistleblower init
yarn start
```

```console
npm run whistleblower init
npm run start
```
