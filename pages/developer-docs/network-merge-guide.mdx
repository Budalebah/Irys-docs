# Node merge

On March 27th, 2024 Irys merged its two mainnet nodes.

This simplifies building on Irys and means you no longer need to:

- Choose a node when uploading
- Care about which node your balance is on

This change is fully backward compatible. You can continue using existing versions of our tools with no changes.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Uploads of less than 100 KiB will remain free on Mainnet and Devnet.
</Callout>
