You can query transaction metadata using the Irys [query package](/developer-docs/querying/query-package) and [GraphQL](/developer-docs/graphql).

The easiest way to query Irys and Arweave transactions is by using the [Irys query package](/developer-docs/querying/query-package), a JavaScript-based abstraction that sits on top of our GraphQL endpoints.

Irys also supports querying directly using GraphQL. Users can query [Irys directly using the GraphQL sandbox](/developer-docs/querying/graphql#graphql-sandbox), or embed GraphQL queries in any other programming language.
