# Fund / withdraw

The FundWithdraw UI component is used to manage node balances.

## Funding and withdrawing

When uploading data to Bundlr, first connect to and then fund a node. Balances are not shared between nodes, fund the node you intend to use.

## Customizing the UI

The FundWithdraw component provides a default UI that includes options for the end user to select a node, choose a currency, and decide between funding or withdrawing.

You can also modify the UI to hardwire the node address, currency, or fix the mode (either to "fund-only" or "withdraw-only") using configuration parameters.

| Description               | Code                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Default Behavior          | `<FundWithdraw />`                                     |
| Fix the node              | `<FundWithdraw node="https://node1.bundlr.network" />` |
| Fix the currency          | `<FundWithdraw currency="ethereum" />`                 |
| Set to fund-only mode     | `<FundWithdraw fundOnly={ true } />`                   |
| Set to withdraw-only mode | `<FundWithdraw withdrawOnly={ true }/>`                |

If both fundOnly and withdrawOnly are set to false, the component defaults to fund-only mode.

## Code

The component is designed to be used as-is. Users making significant changes to the UI will need to understand the following.

### Atomic units

When funding and withdrawing using the functions [`bundlr.fund()`](/developer-docs/sdk/api/fund) or [`bundlr.withdrawBalance()`](/developer-docs/sdk/api/withdrawBalance), pass a value in atomic units.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Atomic units refer to the smallest possible unit of a given cryptocurrency. In Ethereum, atomic units are called
	Wei, and they represent the smallest unit of Ether. Similar to how 1 dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, 1
	Ether can be broken down into 10^18 Wei. In Solana, atomic units are called Lamports, 1 SOL can be broken down into
	10^9 Lamports.
</Callout>

### Getting funded balance

When the component is set to "withdraw" mode, the UI will automatically check and display the user's currently funded balance. As balances are both node and currency-specific, this balance check is encapsulated within a `useEffect()` hook that gets triggered when the component mounts and also whenever the user changes either the selected node or currency.

To get the currently funded balance, first connect to a Bundlr node using the node and currency selected by the user:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const bundlr = await getBundlr(selectedNode?.value, selectedCurrency?.value);
```

Then retrieve the loaded balance in atomic units:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();
```

And convert to standard units before setting to a React state variable:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
setAmount(bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(loadedBalance));
```

Here’s the full code:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
useEffect(() => {
	setAmount(0);
	const getCurBalance = async () => {
		try {
			const bundlr = await getBundlr(selectedNode?.value, selectedCurrency?.value);
			const loadedBalance = await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();

			// Show currently funded balance iff we're in withdraw mode
			if (!isFunding) setAmount(bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(loadedBalance));
		} catch (error) {
			console.log("Error connecting to Bundlr:", error);
		}
	};
	if (selectedNode && selectedCurrency) getCurBalance();
}, [selectedNode, selectedCurrency, isFunding]);
```

### Funding & withdrawing

Funding and withdrawing happen in the function `handleFundWithdraw()`. This function first validates input, then connects to a Bundlr node:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const bundlr = await getBundlr(selectedNode?.value, selectedCurrency?.value);
```

When funding, convert the value entered by the user to atomic units and then use that value to fund:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const fundTx = await bundlr.fund(bundlr.utils.toAtomic(amount));
```

When withdrawing, convert the value entered by the user to atomic units and then use that value to withdraw:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const fundTx = await bundlr.withdrawBalance(bundlr.utils.toAtomic(amount));
```
