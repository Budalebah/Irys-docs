# Fund / Withdraw

The fund / withdraw UI component is used to manage node balances.

## Funding and withdrawing

When uploading data to Bundlr, first connect to and then fund a node. Balances are not shared between nodes, fund the node you intend to use.

For dApps where end-users are responsible for upload costs, use this component so your users can both fund and withdraw from nodes. You can customize the UI using component parameters, anchoring it to a single node and payment token.

For those using our gasless uploader, you can use this component to easily top-up node balances.

## Customizing the UI

The FundWithdraw component provides a default UI that includes options for the end user to select a node, choose a currency, and decide between funding or withdrawing. You can also modify the UI to hardwire the node address, currency, or fix the mode (either to "fund-only" or "withdraw-only") using configuration parameters.

| Description               | Code                                                                 |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default Behavior          | `<FundWithdraw />`                                                   |
| Fix the node              | `<FundWithdraw config={{ node: "https://node1.bundlr.network" }} />` |
| Fix the currency          | `<FundWithdraw config={{ currency: "ethereum" }} />`                 |
| Set to fund-only mode     | `<FundWithdraw config={{ fundOnly: true }} />`                       |
| Set to withdraw-only mode | `<FundWithdraw config={{ withdrawOnly: true }} />`                   |

If both fundOnly and withdrawOnly are set to false, the component defaults to the "fund-only" mode.

## Code

The component is designed to be used as-is, however, you are welcome to manually customize it in any way you need. Below are key code aspects to retain during modifications.

### Atomic units

When funding and withdrawing using the functions [`bundlr.fund()`](/developer-docs/sdk/api/fund) or [`bundlr.withdrawBalance()`](/developer-docs/sdk/api/withdrawBalance), pass a value in atomic units.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Atomic units refer to the smallest possible unit of a given cryptocurrency. In Ethereum, atomic units are called
	Wei, and they represent the smallest unit of Ether. Similar to how 1 dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, 1
	Ether can be broken down into 10^18 Wei. In Solana, atomic units are called Lamports, 1 SOL can be broken down into
	10^9 Lamports.
</Callout>

### Getting funded balance

When the component is set to "withdraw" mode, the UI will automatically check and display the user's currently funded balance. This enhances the UX by allowing users to see exactly how much they can withdraw. Given that balances are both node and currency-specific, this balance check is encapsulated within a `useEffect()` hook that gets triggered when the component mounts and also whenever the user changes either the selected node or currency.

To get the currently funded balance, first connect to a Bundlr node using the Node and currency selected by the user:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const bundlr = await getBundlr(selectedNode?.value, selectedCurrency?.value);
```

Then retrieve the loaded balance in atomic units:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();
```

And convert to standard units before setting to a React state variable:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
setAmount(bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(loadedBalance));
```

Here’s the full code:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
useEffect(() => {
	setAmount(0);
	const getCurBalance = async () => {
		try {
			const bundlr = await getBundlr(selectedNode?.value, selectedCurrency?.value);
			const loadedBalance = await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();

			// Show currently funded balance iff we're in withdraw mode
			if (!isFunding) setAmount(bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(loadedBalance));
		} catch (error) {
			console.log("Error connecting to Bundlr:", error);
		}
	};
	if (selectedNode && selectedCurrency) getCurBalance();
}, [selectedNode, selectedCurrency, isFunding]);
```

### Funding & withdrawing

Funding and withdrawing happen in the function `handleFundWithdraw()`. This function first validates input, then connects to a Bundlr node:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const bundlr = await getBundlr(selectedNode?.value, selectedCurrency?.value);
```

When funding, the function first converts the value entered by the user to atomic units and then uses that value to fund:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const fundTx = await bundlr.fund(bundlr.utils.toAtomic(amount));
```

And when withdrawing, the function does the same:

```ts filename="components/FundWithdraw.tsx"
const fundTx = await bundlr.withdrawBalance(bundlr.utils.toAtomic(amount));
```
