# Progress-bar uploader

The progress bar uploader is designed for larger files whose upload will take more than a few seconds. It provides visual feedback of upload progress in the form of a progress bar.

/>

## Uploading

The component uses a lazy funding approach, it first determines the cost to upload the chosen file, then checks the user's loaded balance, only funding more if needed. Once uploaded, a link to the file is shown in the UI and stored in the `fileUrl` state variable.

## Customizing the UI

You can customize the behavior of the component to either show or hide the preview panel. Users may choose to hide the panel if it doesn't fit with their UI design, or if they are uploading files other than images or videos.

| Description           | Code                                                      |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Default Behavior      | `<ProgressBarUploader />`                                 |
| Hide the file preview | `<ProgressBarUploader config={{ showPreview: false }} />` |

If the `showPreview` parameter is not provided, the component defaults to showing the preview.

## Code

The progress bar uploader uses our [chunked uploader](/developer-docs/sdk/chunked-uploader), which gives users fine-grained control over how files are uploaded. You can specify how to break a large file into smaller "chunks", how big each should be and how many should be uploaded at once. The uploader also supports event callbacks which update you on the upload's progress.

The progress bar is controlled using the `progress` state variable, as its value is incrementally updated from 0 to 100, the visual representation automatically updates.

```ts filename="components/ProgressBarUploader.tsx"
const [progress, setProgress] = useState<number>(0);
```

### Using the chunked uploader

When setting up the chunked uploader, configure it by setting the batch size and chunk size. You may need to experiment with these values as you build your application, the ideal configuration will depend on factors like your average file size and the quality of your end-user's internet connections.

```ts filename="components/ProgressBarUploader.tsx"
const bundlr = await getBundlr();

const uploader = bundlr.uploader.chunkedUploader;
uploader.setBatchSize(1);
uploader.setChunkSize(2000000);
```

### Event callbacks

Three different event handlers are supported.

`chunkUpload`: Called after each chunk is uploaded, updates the progress bar.

```ts filename="components/ProgressBarUploader.tsx"
uploader.on("chunkUpload", (chunkInfo) => {
	const chunkNumber = chunkInfo.id + 1;
	// update the progress bar based on how much has been uploaded
	if (chunkNumber >= totalChunks) setProgress(100);
	else setProgress((chunkNumber / totalChunks.current) * 100);
});
```

`error`: Called if an error happens. In most cases, these can be ignored as the uploader automatically retries the upload whenever an error happens.

```ts filename="components/ProgressBarUploader.tsx"
uploader.on("chunkError", (e) => {
	console.error(`Error uploading chunk number ${e.id} - ${e.res.statusText}`);
});
```

`done`: Called when the upload is complete.

```ts filename="components/ProgressBarUploader.tsx"
uploader.on("done", (finishRes) => {
	console.log(`Upload completed with ID ${finishRes.id}`);
	// Set the progress bar to 100
	setProgress(100);
});
```

## Uploading the file

Finally the file is passed to the uploader and the URL to the file is shown in the UI and stored in a state variable. The file is uploaded with strong provenance, to obtain a copy of the [receipt](/learn/receipts), you can request it by passing the transaction id to our SDK function [`bundlr.utils.getReceipt()`](/developer-docs/sdk/api/utils-getReceipt)

```ts filename="components/ProgressBarUploader.tsx"
await uploader
	.uploadData(dataStream, {
		tags: [{ name: "Content-Type", value: fileType }],
		upload: { getReceiptSignature: true },
	})
	.then((res) => {
		setFileUrl(`https://arweave.net/${res.data.id}`);
		setMessage(`File <a class="underline" target="_blank" href="https://arweave.net/${res.data.id}">uploaded</a>`);
	})
	.catch((e) => {
		setMessage("Upload error " + e.message);
	});
```
