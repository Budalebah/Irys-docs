# Irys Nodes

Irys has three nodes.

    - `https://node1.irys.xyz`: Permanent data with strong provenance
    - `https://node2.irys.xyz`:  Permanent data with strong provenance
    - `https://devnet.irys.xyz`: Devnet where uploads are stored for ~60 days, supports permanent storage and strong provenance uploads

## Connecting To A Node

See our docs for code samples showing [how to connect to an Irys node when uploading](/developer-docs/irys-sdk#connect-to-a-node), and [when querying](/developer-docs/query-sdk#changing-default-query-endpoints).
