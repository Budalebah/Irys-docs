# Downloading Data

The transaction id returned from uploading data is used to generate an URL you can use to then view or download the data. The format used is `https://arweave.net/[transaction_id]`. For example https://arweave.net/CO9EpX0lekJEfXUOeXncUmMuG8eEp5WJHXl9U9yZUYA.

Alternatively, you can download data uploaded via Bundlr using our gateway; the URL format is the same `https://gateway.bundlr.network/tx/[transaction_id]`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	The Bundlr gateway only returns data stored on Arweave uploaded via Bundlr, it will not return data uploaded
	directly to Arweave.
