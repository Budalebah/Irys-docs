<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Atomic units refer to the smallest possible unit of a given cryptocurrency. In
	Ethereum, atomic units are called Wei, and they represent the smallest unit of Ether.
	Similar to how 1 dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, 1 Ether can be broken down
	into 10^18 Wei. In Solana, atomic units are called Lamports, 1 SOL can be broken down
	into 10^9 Lamports.
