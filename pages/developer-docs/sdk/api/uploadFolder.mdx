description: Uploads a folder of files to Bundlr.

# `uploadFolder()`

Uploads a group of files.

This function exists on both [`Bundlr`](/developer-docs/sdk/api/uploadFolder#bundlruploadfolder) and [`WebBundlr`](/developer-docs/sdk/api/uploadFolder#webbundlruploadfolder) classes, however the parameters and return types differ.

## `bundlr.uploadFolder()`

Uploads a folder directly from the local filesystem.

**Parameters**

<div className="-mt-6" />

-   `folderToUpload`: Path to the folder being uploaded
-   `indexFile`: (optional) The name of an index file also included in the folder
    you upload. If provided, this index file will load when a user requests
    `https://arweave.net/[manifest_id]`
-   `batchSize`: (optional) The number of files to upload at once.
-   `keepDeleted`: (optional) Whether to keep now deleted
    items from previous uploads. When you upload a folder, the file names are
    indexed and saved. If you then re-upload that same folder, Bundlr will only
    upload new files added since the previous upload. In the case where you delete
    files from your source directory, this flag tells Bundlr whether to keep those
    deleted files in the index or remove them.

**Returns**

<div className="-mt-6" />

-   `response`: A JSON object with the following values

```json
response = {
  id, // The transaction id of the upload
  timestamp: // The timestamp of when the transaction was uploaded and verified
}
```

```js
const folderToUpload = "./myNFTs/"; // Path to folder
try {
	const response = await bundlr.uploadFolder(folderToUpload, {
		indexFile: "index.html",
		batchSize: 50,
		keepDeleted: false,
	});

	console.log(`Files uploaded. Manifest Id ${response.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```

### File paths

Files uploaded via `bundlr.uploadFolder()` can be retrieved in one of two ways.

1. Creating an URL with the format `https://arweave.net/[manifest-id]/[file-name]`.
2. Creating an URL using the transaction ID of each individual file uploaded with the format `https://arweave.net/[transacton-id]`

After a successful folder upload, two files are written to your local project directory `[folder_name].csv` and `[folder_name].json`. The example below highlights a folder called “llama_folder” with a total of 5 files in it. The transaction id for each file can be used to retrieve the uploaded data by forming an URL with the format `https://arweave.net]/[transaction-id]`

## `webBundlr.uploadFolder()`

Uploads a folder or array of [`File`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File) objects from the browser.

**Parameters**

<div className="-mt-6" />

-   `files`: An array of `File` objects to upload
-   `opts`: Additional upload options. Properties include:
    -   `indexFileRelPath`: Relative path to the index file within the uploaded folder
    -   `manifestTags`: Tags to be associated with the uploaded manifest
    -   `getReceiptSignature`: Set to true to have a [receipt](/learn/receipts) generated

**Returns**

<div className="-mt-6" />

-   `response`: A JSON object with the following values

```json
response = {
  block, // Deprecated
  deadlineHeight, // Block number by which the transaction must be finalized on Arweave
  id, // Transaction id (can be used to request the receipt)
  manifest, // Manifest
  manifestId, // Manifest id (used to generate relative file paths)
  public, // Public key used to sign the upload
  signature, // Upload signature
  timestamp, // Upload timestamp (millisecond accurate)
  txs, // Array of DataItems, one for each file uploaded plus one for the whole upload
}
```

```ts
const tx = await webBundlr.uploadFolder(files, {
	getReceiptSignature: true,
});
```

### File paths

Files uploaded via `webBundlr.uploadFolder()` can be retrieved in one of two ways.

1. Creating an URL with the format `https://arweave.net/[manifest-id]/[file-name]`.
2. Creating an URL using the transaction ID of each individual file uploaded with the format `https://arweave.net/[transacton-id]`
