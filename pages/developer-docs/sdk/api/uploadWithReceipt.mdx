# `bundlr.utils.uploadWithReceipt(data, tags)`

Uploads any data passed to it, returns a [signed receipt](/learn/receipts). This function is a part of our [Proof Of Provenance](/overview/solutions/proof-of-provenance) and only works on node 1, and Devnet. It will return an error message if invoked on node 2.

**Parameters**

-   `data`: The data to upload
-   `tags`: Optional [metatags](/developer-docs/tags)

**Returns**

-   `response`: A JSON object with the following values

```json
response = {
  id, // Transaction id (used to download the data)
  timestamp, // Timestamp (UNIX milliseconds) of when the transaction was created and verified
  version, // The version of this JSON file, currently 1.0.0
  public, // Public key of the bundler node used
  signature, // A signed deep hash of the JSON receipt
  deadlineHeight, // The block number by which the transaction must be finalized on Arweave
  block, // Deprecated
  validatorSignatures, // Reserved for future use once we're decentralized
  verify, // An async function used to verify the receipt at any time
}
```

```js
// Data to upload
const dataToUpload = "GM world.";
try {
	const receipt = await bundlr.upload(dataToUpload);
	console.log(`Data uploaded ==> https://arweave.net/${receipt.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```
