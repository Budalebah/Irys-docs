The Bundlr SDK includes utility functions.

const txId = ""; // Your transaction Id
const receipt = bundlr.utils.getReceipt(txId);
```

## Currency Conversion

Functions that assist in converting between atomic units standard denominations.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Atomic units refer to the smallest possible unit of a given cryptocurrency. In Ethereum, atomic units are called
	Wei, and they represent the smallest unit of Ether. Similar to how 1 dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, 1
	Ether can be broken down into 10^18 Wei. In Solana, atomic units are called Lamports, 1 SOL can be broken down into
	10^9 Lamports.
</Callout>

### `bundlr.utils.toAtomic()`

Converts from standard to atomic units.

Example code:

```js
const fundAmountAtomic = bundlr.utils.toAtomic(fundAmountStandard);
```

### `bundlr.utils.fromAtomic()`

Example code:

```js
const atomicBalance = await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();
const convertedBalance = bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(atomicBalance).toString();
```
