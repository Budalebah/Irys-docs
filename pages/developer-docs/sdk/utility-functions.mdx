# Utility Functions

The Bundlr SDK includes utility functions that assist in converting between atomic units standard denominations.

:::note
Atomic units refer to the smallest possible unit of a given cryptocurrency. In Ethereum, atomic units are called Wei, and they represent the smallest unit of Ether. Similar to how 1 dollar can be broken down into 100 cents, 1 Ether can be broken down into 10^18 Wei. In Solana, atomic units are called Lamports, 1 SOL can be broken down into 10^9 Lamports.
:::

## `bundlr.utils.toAtomic()`

Converts from standard to atomic units.

Example code:

```js
const fundAmountAtomic = bundlr.utils.toAtomic(fundAmountStandard);
```

## `bundlr.utils.fromAtomic()`

Converts from atomic to standard units.

Example code:

```js
const atomicBalance = await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();
const convertedBalance = bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(atomicBalance).toString();
```
