# Connecting To A Node

When using the chunking uploader, first connect to a node using the same flow as with our default uploader and then follow that by requesting the chunked uploader using `bundlr.uploader.chunkedUploader`.

You can use any of our [public and devnet node addresses.](/sdk/basic-features/connecting-node)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
The chunkedUploader object reference must be updated before each subsequent upload, it can not be reused.
</Callout>

```js
import Bundlr from "@bundlr-network/client";
import fs from "fs";

// Change this line to match the name of the wallet key file
const privateKey = "";
const jwk = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(privateKey).toString());

// First create a Bundlr object
// NOTE: Depending on the version of JavaScript / TypeScript you use, you may need to use
// the commented out line below to create a new Bundlr object.
// const bundlr = new Bundlr("http://node1.bundlr.network", "arweave", jwk);
const bundlr = new Bundlr.default("http://node1.bundlr.network", "arweave", jwk);

// Now get a reference to the chunked uploader
// If you're doing more than one upload, you will need to refresh this
// object reference for each upload.
let uploader = bundlr.uploader.chunkedUploader;
```
