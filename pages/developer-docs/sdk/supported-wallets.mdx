# Supported Wallets

You can use Bundlr with any wallet on any of our supported blockchains. This includes MetaMask for Ethereum-based chains, Phantom for Solana, ARConnect for Arweave, and others. Our tutorials section provides a step-by-step guide for setting up an Arweave wallet.

We support payment for uploads in [14 different tokens](/overview/supported-tokens).
