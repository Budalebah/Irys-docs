# Withdrawing Funds

Funds deposited into a node can be easily withdrawn at any time.

## `bundlr.withdrawBalance()`

Withdraws the supplied amount and returns a response object that includes transaction id, requested amount, network fees, and final cost. The parameter value must in atomic units.

The code below checks the funded balance and then withdraws it all.

```js
try {
	// 400 - something went wrong
	// response.data = "Not enough balance for requested withdrawal"

	// 200 - Ok
	// response.data = {
	// requested, // the requested amount,
	// fee, // the reward required by the network (network fee)
	// final, // total cost to your account (requested + fee)
	// tx_id, // the ID of the withdrawal transaction
	// }
	// 1. Get current balance
	const curBalance = await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();
	// 2. Withdraw all
	const response = await bundlr.withdrawBalance(curBalance);

	console.log(`Funds withdrawn txID=${response.data.tx_id} amount requested=${response.data.requested}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error funding node ", e);
}
```
