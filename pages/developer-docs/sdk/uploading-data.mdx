# Uploading Data

## `bundlr.upload()`

Uploads any data passed to it. The transaction id returned as part of the response is used to download the data using an URL with the format `https://arweave.net/[transaction_id]`

```js
// Upload data
const dataToUpload = "Hello world.";
try {
	const response = await bundlr.upload(dataToUpload);
	console.log(`Data uploaded ==> https://arweave.net/${response.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```
