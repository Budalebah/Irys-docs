# Bundlr + UMD Bundle

When using Bundlr in the browser, you can either install using npm / yarn if you’re using a framework or load via a CDN if you’re using VanillaJS / CommonJS. To load via a CDN, include the following URL

```html
https://unpkg.com/@bundlr-network/client/build/web/bundle.js
```

Include via a script tag (in the head section of your main html file).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@bundlr-network/client/build/web/bundle.js"></script>
```
