# Using Devnet

Bundlr has a Devnet that is perfect to use when building projects or when learning our SDK. Files uploaded to the Devnet are kept for approximately 60 days, however, this may change over time. When using the Devnet, you pay for transactions using free cryptocurrency available from publicly available faucets (mumbai faucet, goerli faucet, solana faucet).

When using our normal network it is not necessary to specify an RPC, we automatically use publicly available ones. When working with the Devnet, it is necessary to supply a devnet RPC for the chain youâ€™re using. The following examples show how to create both a Bundlr and WebBundlr object using devnet RPCs.

```js
const bundlr = new Bundlr("https://devnet.bundlr.network", "solana", "<solana private key>", {
	providerUrl: "https://api.devnet.solana.com",
});

const bundlr = new WebBundlr("https://devnet.bundlr.network", "matic", provider, {
	providerUrl: "https://rpc-mumbai.matic.today",
});
```
