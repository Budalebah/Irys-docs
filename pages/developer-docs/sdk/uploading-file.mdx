# Uploading A File

## `bundlr.uploadFile()`

Uploads a file directly from your local file system.

The transaction id returned as part of the response is used to download the data, simply create a URL with the format `https://arweave.net/[transaction_id].`

```js
// Upload a file
const fileToUpload = "fileName";
try {
	const response = await bundlr.uploadFile("./" + fileToUpload);
	console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://arweave.net/${response.id}`);
} catch (e) {
	console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
}
```
