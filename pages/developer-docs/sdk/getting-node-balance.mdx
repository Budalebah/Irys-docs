# Getting Node Balance

## `bundlr.getLoadedBalance()`

Returns your wallet’s balance on that node in atomic units. You can convert that into standard units using [`bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(atomicUnits)`](/developer-docs/sdk/utility-functions).

```js
// Get loaded balance in atomic units
const atomicBalance = await bundlr.getLoadedBalance();
console.log(`node balance (atomic units) = ${atomicBalance}`);

// Convert balance to an easier to read format
const convertedBalance = bundlr.utils.fromAtomic(atomicBalance);
console.log(`node balance (converted) = ${convertedBalance}`);
```

	Balances are not shared between nodes, each node maintains its own ledger of user balances.
