# Status updates

## NodeJS v20

**Monday November 6th, 2023**

The Irys SDK and CLI are not currently compatible with NodeJS v20. This is a known issue that has to do with invalid signatures being generated by this version of NodeJS only. Until we push a fix, please use previous versions of NodeJS which are fully supported.
