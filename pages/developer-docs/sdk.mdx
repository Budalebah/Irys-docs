# SDK

Implement [permanent decentralized storage](/overview/solutions/permanent-storage) and [Proof of Provenance](/overview/solutions/proof-of-provenance) with just a few lines of code.

## Bundlr & WebBundlr

To get started with the SDK, choose the [Bundlr class](/developer-docs/sdk/bundlr-server-side) for server-side projects and the [WebBundlr class](/developer-docs/sdk/bundlr-in-the-browser) for browser-based projects.

#### Step 1: [Install the SDK](/developer-docs/sdk/installing-the-sdk)

```js
npm install @bundlr-network/client
```

#### Step 2: [Connect To A Bundlr Node](/developer-docs/sdk/connecting-node)

```js
const bundlr = new Bundlr("http://node2.bundlr.network", "matic", "<polygon_private_key>");
```

#### Step 3: [Fund Your Node](/developer-docs/sdk/funding-node) (To Pay For Uploads)

```js
const response = await bundlr.fund(fundAmount);
```

#### Step 4: [Upload Data](/developer-docs/sdk/uploading-data)

```js
const dataToUpload = "GM world.";
const response = await bundlr.upload(dataToUpload);
```

Or upload and [request a cryptographically signed receipt.](/developer-docs/sdk/uploading-data#bundlrutilsuploadwithreceipt)

```js
const dataToUpload = "GM world.";
const receipt = await bundlr.uploadWithReceipt(dataToUpload);
```

#### Step 5: [Download Your Data](/developer-docs/sdk/downloading-data)

```js
console.log(`Data Available at => https://arweave.net/${response.id}`);
```
