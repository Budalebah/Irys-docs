Data stored on Irys is censorship-resistant and immutable, forever.

When you upload data to Irys, it is stamped with attributes of [strong provenance](./strong-provenance) before being passed to Arweave where it is stored permanently.

Permanence guarantees your data can be retrieved at any point in the future. Permanent data is fault-tolerant, tamperproof, and paid-for:

-   <p className="font-bold">Fault-tolerant</p>
    Data is stored so that it can survive unexpected events, including data corruption and loss. This typically comes from
    replicating the data redundantly across geographies and hosts.

-   <p className="font-bold">Tamperproof</p>
    Stored data is immutable, it canâ€™t be maliciously changed.{" "}

-   <p className="font-bold">Paid-for</p>
    The cost of storing the data permanently is covered up-front, and [there is a mechanism for paying miners on an acceptable
    cadence](/learn/transaction-lifecycle).{" "}
