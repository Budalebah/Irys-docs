Irys has three nodes:

-   `https://node1.irys.xyz`
-   `https://node2.irys.xyz`
-   `https://devnet.irys.xyz`

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Our Node URLs have recently changed from `bundlr.network` to `irys.xyz`, if you have an existing project, see our
	[migration guide](/developer-docs/irys-sdk/migration-guide) for details on how to upgrade.

## Mainnet

Uploads to Irys's Mainnet (Nodes 1 and 2) are [stored permanently on Arweave](/learn/transaction-lifecycle). Your upload will remain accessible at all times, even if Irys is no longer available.

Uploads of less than 100 KiB are free on Node 2.

Uploads can be paid for in any of the [14 tokens we support](/overview/supported-tokens).

## Devnet

Uploads to Irys's [Devnet](/developer-docs/using-devnet) are kept for roughly 60 days. The Devnet is for building and prototyping projects along with learning our SDK.

Uploads can be paid for using [free tokens available from faucets](/overview/supported-tokens#devnet-tokens).

## Chain integrations

Irys is multichain, supporting both paying for uploads with [14 tokens](/overview/supported-tokens) and signing that upload using the token’s cryptography. The signature type used to sign a transaction is tracked at the [transaction-level](/learn/bundles).
