# Querying & tagging

Bundlrâ€™s querying and tagging services support [adding custom metadata tags](/developer-docs/tags) to each upload, these tags allow users to build semi-relational data models, all queryable via [GraphQL](/developer-docs/graphql).

## Tagging

Bundlr supports attaching [metadata tags](/developer-docs/tags) to each transaction.

Tags can be used to:

-   Categorize transactions, making it easier to search for and retrieve relevant information using GraphQL
-   Build provenance chains for Proof Of Provenance applications
-   Inform web browsers how to render image files

We also have implementation docs that cover how to add tags to your uploads.

## Querying

Contained within the transaction header is the metadata, this is available for querying via a REST API and [GraphQL](/developer-docs/graphql).

Data is available for downloading via gateways.
