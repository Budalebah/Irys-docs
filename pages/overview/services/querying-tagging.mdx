# Querying & Tagging

Irys' querying and tagging services support [adding custom metadata tags](/developer-docs/tags) to each upload, these tags allow users to build semi-relational data models, all instantly [queryable](/developer-docs/querying).

## Tagging

Irys supports attaching [metadata tags](/developer-docs/tags) to each transaction.

Tags can be used to:

-   Categorize transactions, making it easier to search for and retrieve relevant information using GraphQL
-   Build provenance chains for Proof Of Provenance applications
-   Inform web browsers how to render image files

## Querying

Contained within the transaction header is the metadata, this is available for querying via our [query package](/developer-docs/querying/query-package) and [GraphQL](/developer-docs/querying/graphql).
