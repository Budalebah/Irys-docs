    	Irys' ordering service allows for immutable chronological sequencing of data.

This supports applications that require a guarantee on order such as execution layers (rollups),
messaging and event processing, among others.

When a user uploads a transaction, they are given back a signed [receipt](/learn/receipts) that includes a timestamp, accurate to the millisecond, providing a proof of time. Users can verify the timestamp at any time, ensuring the order is both constant and consistent.

Although the timestamp is currently generated by a centralized service, Bundlr plans to move towards a decentralized infrastructure and introduce a decentralized timestamp validator network. The network will consist of external actors who validate the timestamp's authenticity, providing additional assurances about the transaction's sequence and provenance.
