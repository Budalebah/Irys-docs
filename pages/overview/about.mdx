Irys is the only provenance layer. It enables users to scale permanent data and precisely attribute its origin.

A provenance layer is a ledger of record for digital information, tracking the origins and modifications of data.

Data [uploaded to Irys](/learn/transaction-lifecycle) is permanent, precise, and unconstrained.

-   <p className="font-bold">Permanent</p>
    Data stored on Irys is [censorship-resistant and immutable, forever](/overview/permanent-data). There's no counterparty
    risk of data being removed.

-   <p className="font-bold">Precise</p>
    Each piece of data is [timestamped with a high-precision timestamp](/learn/receipts), providing a reliable sequence of
    events.

-   <p className="font-bold">Unconstrained</p>
    Users can always read, write, and easily discover data at any scale, making the data fully composable. Irys is permissionless
    and offers limitless permanent data, enabling it to provide provenance for all information.

All uploads to Irys are verifiable. After uploading data, you’re given a receipt that can be used by anyone to [verify](/learn/receipts) the data’s provenance at any time.

## Building with Irys

Irys's [developer tools](/overview/tools) make it easy to add permanent data with strong provenance to your projects.
