Data uploaded to Irys is permanent, precise, and unconstrained.

-   Permanent: Data stored on Irys is censorship-resistant and immutable, forever. There's no counterparty risk of data being removed.

-   Precise: Each piece of data is stamped with a high-precision timestamp, providing a reliable sequence of events.

-   Unconstrained: Users can always read, write, and easily discover data at any scale, making the data fully composable. Irys is permissionless and offers limitless permanent data, enabling it to provide provenance for all information.

All uploads to Irys are verifiable. After uploading data, you’re given a receipt that can be used by anyone to verify the data’s provenance at any time.
