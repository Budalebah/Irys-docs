Irys has two networks: mainnet and devnet.

## Mainnet

Uploads to Irys' mainnet are [stored permanently on Arweave](/learn/transaction-lifecycle). Your upload will remain accessible at all times, even if Irys is no longer available.

Uploads of less than 100 KiB are free.

Uploads can be paid for in any of the [many tokens we support](/overview/supported-tokens).

## Devnet

Uploads to Irys' [Devnet](/developer-docs/using-devnet) are kept for roughly 60 days. The Devnet is for building and prototyping projects along with learning our SDK.

Uploads can be paid for using [free tokens available from faucets](/overview/supported-tokens#devnet-tokens).

## Node URLs

Most users will not need the direct node URLs as the SDK abstracts this away. However, if needed, you can use the following:

- `https://arweave.mainnet.irys.xyz`
- `https://arweave.devnet.irys.xyz`

## Chain integrations

Irys is multichain, supporting both paying for uploads with [most popular tokens](/overview/supported-tokens) and signing the upload using that tokenâ€™s cryptography. The signature type used to sign a transaction is tracked at the [transaction-level](/learn/bundles).

## Connecting to Irys

See our [SDK docs for code samples](/developer-docs/irys-sdk#connecting-to-irys) showing how to connect to our mainnet and devnet.

See our docs for code samples showing [how to connect to an Irys node when uploading](/developer-docs/irys-sdk#connect-to-a-node), and [when querying](/developer-docs/query-sdk#changing-default-query-endpoints).
