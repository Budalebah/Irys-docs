Use Irys' tooling to upload directly to the Arweave mainnet or start on Irys' devnet.

## Arweave mainnet

Upload permanently to Arweave. Your data will be retrievable forever. Uploads can be paid for in any of the [many tokens we support](./supported-tokens).

## Devnet

Uploads to Irys' [Devnet](../irys-sdk/using-devnet) are kept for roughly 60 days. Devnet is for building and prototyping projects along with learning our SDK.

Uploads can be paid for using [free tokens available from faucets](./supported-tokens#devnet-tokens).

## Node URLs

Most users will not need the direct node URLs as the SDK abstracts this away. If needed, you can use the following:

- `https://arweave.mainnet.irys.xyz`
- `https://arweave.devnet.irys.xyz`
