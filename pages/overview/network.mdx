Irys has three nodes:

-   `https://node1.irys.xyz`
-   `https://node2.irys.xyz`
-   `https://devnet.irys.xyz`

## Mainnet

Uploads to Irys's Mainnet (Nodes 1 and 2) are finalized on Arweave where they inherit the L1's guarantees of permanence. Your upload will remain accessible at all times, even if Irys is no longer available.

Uploads of less than 100 KiB are free on Node 2.

Uploads to the Mainnet can be paid for in any of the [14 tokens we support](/overview/supported-tokens).

## Devnet

Uploads to Irys's [Devnet](/developer-docs/using-devnet) are kept for roughly 60 days. The Devnet is for building and prototyping projects along with learning our SDK.

## Chain integrations

Irys is multichain, supporting both paying for uploads with [14 tokens](/overview/supported-tokens) and signing that upload using the tokenâ€™s cryptography. The signature type used to sign a transaction is tracked at the [transaction-level](/learn/bundles).
