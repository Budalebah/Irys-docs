    	Iyrs' fee is dynamic and depends on several parameters.

Fees are computed as follows:

```
bundlr_fee(X = number of bytes) =
arweave_cost(max(X, 10000)) *
conversion_rate("AR", token) *
global_multiplier *
oracle_fee
```

-   `arweave_cost` is cost of storing `X` number of bytes on Arweave using linear pricing (i.e. ignoring minimum chunk size). e.g. if `arweave_cost(256KB) = $2.56` then `arweave_cost(1KB) = $0.01`
-   `conversion_rate` is the conversion rate between AR and some other token (e.g. MATIC). This allows users to pay the same fees in different currencies.
-   `global_multiplier` is a multiplier applied to all transactions which can be seen as a “profit margin”.
-   `oracle_fee` is a risk multiplier which accounts for cost of treasury management and asset volatility.
