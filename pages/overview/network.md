## Nodes

Bundlr has three nodes. Uploads to node 1 and node 2 are permanent. Uploads of less than 100 KiB are currently free on node 2.

-   `https://node2.bundlr.network`
-   `https://devnet.bundlr.network`

## Mainnet

Uploads to Bundlr's Mainnet are finalized on Arweave where they inherit the L1's guarantees of permanence. Your upload will remain accessible at all times, even if Bundlr is no longer available.

Uploads to the Mainnet can be paid for in any of the [14 tokens we support](/overview/supported-tokens).

## Devnet

Uploads to Bundlr's [Devnet](/developer-docs/using-devnet) are kept for roughly 60 days. The Devnet is for building and prototyping projects along with learning our SDK.

## Chain Integrations

Bundlr is multichain, supporting both paying for uploads with [14 tokens](/overview/supported-tokens) and signing that upload using the tokenâ€™s cryptography. The signature type used to sign a transaction is tracked at the [transaction-level](/learn/bundles).
