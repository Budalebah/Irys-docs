This supports applications that require a guarantee on order such as execution layers (rollups),
messaging and event processing, among others.

## Proof of time

Each transaction comes with a [signed receipt](/learn/receipts) that includes a verifiable timestamp, which is accurate to the millisecond. With this, users can always rely on the chronology of their data.

## Search seamlessly

[Tags](/developer-docs/tags) categorize transactions. Timestamps order them. Together, tags and timestamps enable users to categorize and order their data to efficiently search for data with [single queries](/developer-docs/querying/query-package).

## Getting started

You can upload multiple transactions and sequence them using our [SDK](/developer-docs/irys-sdk) and [query package](/developer-docs/querying/query-package) in a few lines of code.

### Uploading

```js
// Connect to a node
const irys = new Irys({ url, token, key });

// Fund the node
const fundTx = await irys.fund(irys.utils.toAtomic(0.05));

// Tag your uploads
const tags = [{ name: "application-id", value: "my-tx-sequence" }];

// Upload 10 transactions
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	const receipt = await irys.upload("GM " + i, { tags });
	console.log(`Transaction #${i} uploaded at ${receipt.timestamp}`);
}
```

### Ordering

```js
const myQuery = new Query();
const results = await myQuery
	.search("irys:transactions")
	.tags([{ name: "application-id", values: ["my-tx-sequence"] }])
	.sort("ASC")
	.stream();

// Iterate over the results
for await (const result of stream) {
	console.log(result);
}
```

### Beginners

Beginners should start with our [provenance chain tutorial](/hands-on/tutorials/provenance-chain). In less than a page of code you will create multiple transactions, and use the [query package](/developer-docs/querying/query-package) to sequence them chronologically.
