## Uploading

When uploading to Irys, users are given a signed [receipt](/learn/receipts) that includes a timestamp, accurate to the millisecond of when the upload occured. The receipt can be used to verify the transaction at any time, even if Irys is no longer available.

Users donâ€™t have to wait for uploads to be confirmed and seeded on Arweave. Irys' [optimistic finality](/terminology#optimistic-finalization) guarantees each transaction will be confirmed on Arweave for at least 50 blocks and also seeded to multiple reputable miners. This is further detailed in [transaction lifecycle](/learn/transaction-lifecycle).

Irys' upload performance is on par with traditional Web2 providers, with upload times as low as 8 milliseconds and the ability to scale to millions of transactions per second.

Irys supports paying with [14 different tokens](/overview/supported-tokens), including ETH, SOL, and MATIC, making it easy for users to sign and pay for storage.

## Bundling

Uploading large numbers of files to Arweave can be technically challenging due to Arweave's limit of 1000 transactions per block. When demand spikes, that drives up fees, making permanent data unaffordable for many users. To address these challenges, bundlers are used to collate transactions into a single bundle and submit them to Arweave.

These transactions are instantly retrievable and available to be [queried](/developer-docs/querying). It is not necessary to wait for uploads to be confirmed and seeded on Arweave before they appear in query results.

The implementation of bundlers and bundles has helped stabilize feeds on Arweave.
