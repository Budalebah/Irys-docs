# Bundler

A bundler is a node on Bundlr that bundles transactions sent to it by users into a smaller number of Arweave transactions using a [binary serialization format](https://github.com/joshbenaron/arweave-standards/blob/ans104/ans/ANS-104.md). These transactions are then instantly accessible from the Arweave gateway. Users (identified by wallet address) send a supported currency to the bundlers they want to use via their payment channel.
