Bundles consist of multiple transactions collated together and written to Arweave as a single transaction. Each transaction in a bundle is called a DataItem. A DataItem shares many properties with a regular data transaction, including owner, data, tags, target, signature, and id. However, it cannot transfer tokens and does not have a reward, as the top-level transaction covers the reward for all bundled data.

## Why Bundles?

Bundles allow for infinite transaction scaling - allowing up to 2^256 transactions to be stored in a single bundle. As bundle sizes increase, Arweave's transaction capacity can increase linearly - i.e. using 1 million item bundles allows for a 1,000,000x increase in layer 1 transaction capacity.

## Nested Bundles

Bundles can be nested within other bundles, theoretically allowing for unlimited levels of nesting. However, items within a nested bundle are not accessible through our [GQL](/developer-docs/querying).

## Bundle spec and implementations

The bundle spec, designed by Irys, is open-sourced and is currently implemented in [JavaScript](https://github.com/Irys-xyz/arbundles), [Go](https://github.com/everFinance/goar), and [Rust](https://github.com/Irys-xyz/rust-sdk).
