# Installing The SDK

The Bundlr SDK can be installed using npm or yarn. This SDK includes both the `Bundlr` object used for server-side connections and the `WebBundlr` object for Bundlr in the browser. For `WebBundlr` users, we have [detailed instructions on using Bundlr with React](/recipes/Bundlr-React).

Using npm:

```
npm install @bundlr-network/client
```

Using yarn:

```
yarn add @bundlr-network/client
```
