# Define NFT licensing with the UDL

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to attach a [Universal Data License (UDL)](https://mirror.xyz/0x64eA438bd2784F2C52a9095Ec0F6158f847182d9/AjNBmiD4A4Sw-ouV9YtCO6RCq0uXXcGwVJMB5cdfbhE) to an NFT.

The UDL is a parameterized license you can use to explicitly define how you allow your content to be used.

## Overview

Purchasing an NFT not only gives you ownership of the token itself but, depending on the collection, may also grant certain rights over the underlying intellectual property. These rights cover things like creating derivative works or merchandising the artwork on items such as t-shirts. [Each NFT collection varies in the rights it provides to its token holders](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/article/what-rights-come-with-your-nft/?sh=416b44b06fe7) and historically, there hasn't been a straightforward, customizable license attached to NFTs.

With the UDL creators now have a simple, customizable license they can easily attach to NFT metadata at upload that spells out the permissions they grant to the token holders.

## Adding UDL to NFTs

When uploading an NFT, [you first upload the visual asset, then embed the link to that in a metadata file and then upload the metadata file](/hands-on/tutorials/uploading-nfts).

When uploading the metadata, you can modify your upload script to attach UDL terms to the file. One way to do this is by forking the [Bundlr Provenance Toolkit repository](/developer-docs/provenance-toolkit) and using the UDL Uploader component to upload the metadata. This tool presents a simple UI you can use to define the rights you grant over your intellectual property.

If youâ€™re using our NodeJS SDK to upload your metadata files, you can modify your upload script to include the UDL parameters. [Not all UDL tags are required](https://arwiki.wiki/#/en/Universal-Data-License-How-to-use-it), and the ones you use will depend on how you want to allow your content to be used. The script below demonstrates how to add common tags to a metadata file upload, when using it for your own project, customize as needed.

```ts
import Bundlr from "@bundlr-network/client";
import * as fs from "fs";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

// Define the Tag type
type Tag = {
	name: string;
	value: string;
};

// Connect to a Bundlr node
const privateKey = process.env.PRIVATE_KEY;
const currency = "matic";
const bundlr = new Bundlr("http://devnet.bundlr.network", currency, privateKey, {
	providerUrl: "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com",
});

// Path to metadata file
const fileToUpload = "./metadata.json";

// Define your unique license
const tags: Tag[] = [
	{ name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" },
	{ name: "Contract", value: "0xd9145CCE52D386f254917e481eB44e9943F39138" },
	{ name: "Payment-Mode", value: "Global-Distribution" },
	{ name: "License", value: "yRj4a5KMctX_uOmKWCFJIjmY8DeJcusVk6-HzLiM_t8" },
	{ name: "License-Fee", value: "Monthly-1" },
	{ name: "Derivation", value: "Allowed-With-Credit" },
	{ name: "Commerical-Use", value: "Allowed" },
	{ name: "Currency", value: "ETH" },
];

// Upload the metadata with UDL tags
async function uploadMetadata() {
	try {
		const response = await bundlr.uploadFile(fileToUpload, tags);
		console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://arweave.net/${response.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
	}
}

uploadMetadata();
```
