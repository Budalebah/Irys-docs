# Encrypting on-chain data (server-side)

Data uploaded to Irys is stored permanently on Arweave. Once on Arweave, this data becomes publicly accessible, anyone can view it. For projects where privacy is a concern, you can use [LitProtocol](https://litprotocol.com/) to encrypt your data before storing it on Irys.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	This guide covers how to use the Irys and Lit Protocol server-side SDKs. We also have a [tutorial teaching how to
	encrypt data when working in the browser](./browser-based-encryption).
</Callout>

This guide teaches you how to:

-   Encrypt data using Lit Protocol
-   Establish a set of rules determining who can decrypt the data
-   Store encrypted data on Arweave using Irys
-   Decrypt data using Lit Protocol

All of the code from this guide is also contained in [GitHub repository](https://github.com/irys-xyz/irys-lit).

## Dependencies

To follow along with this guide, you will need to install the following using npm:

```console
npm install @irys/sdk @lit-protocol/lit-node-client-nodejs@^3 dotenv ethers@^5 siwe@^2.1.4
```

or yarn:

```console
yarn add @irys/sdk @lit-protocol/lit-node-client-nodejs@^3 dotenv ethers@^5 siwe@^2.1.4
```

## Imports

To run the code in this project, you'll need to import the following:

```js

## Encrypting data

<img

	src="/img/tutorials/encrypting/irys-lit-encrypting.png"
/>
There are three steps to encrypting data

-   Obtain a wallet signature ([AuthSig](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/authentication/overview#obtain-an-authsig)), which proves you own a wallet
-   Define [access control conditions](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/intro) for who can decrypt your data
-   Connect to a Lit node and request that it encrypt your data

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Lit Protocol supports both wallet signatures and [session
	signatures](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/authentication/session-sigs/intro). This guide focuses solely
	on wallet signatures, as session signatures are currently in development and only available for Ethereum.
</Callout>

### Wallet signature

A wallet signature (`AuthSig`) demonstrates true ownership of a wallet. By signing a basic transaction, regardless of its contents, you verify access to the wallet.

First, create a file called `.env` with a single value, and include your private key.

```json
PRIVATE_KEY=
```

Then, create a helper function that creates a message and signs it using your private key.

```js
async function getAuthSig() {
	// Initialize the signer
	const wallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);
	const address = ethers.utils.getAddress(await wallet.getAddress());

	// Craft the SIWE message
	const domain = "localhost";
	const origin = "https://localhost/login";
	const statement = "This is a test statement. You can put anything you want here.";
	const siweMessage = new siwe.SiweMessage({
		domain,
		address: address,
		statement,
		uri: origin,
		version: "1",
		chainId: "1",
	});
	const messageToSign = siweMessage.prepareMessage();

	// Sign the message and format the authSig
	const signature = await wallet.signMessage(messageToSign);
	const authSig = {
		sig: signature,
		derivedVia: "web3.eth.personal.sign",
		signedMessage: messageToSign,
		address: address,
	};

	return authSig;
}
```

### Access control conditions

Lit Protocol enables users to set [access control conditions](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/intro) specifying who can decrypt data. This provides builders with the flexibility to designate data decryption permissions, including:

-   A single wallet address
-   DAO membership
-   Owners of an ERC20 or ERC721
-   Outcomes from a smart contract call
-   Outcomes from an API call

To ensure anyone can run the code in this repository, it uses the following for access control, allowing anyone with an ETH balance `>=` 0 to decrypt. More details on the different types of access control conditions supported by Lit [can be found in their documentation](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/access-control/intro).

```ts
// This defines who can decrypt the data
function getAccessControlConditions() {
	const accessControlConditions = [
		{
			contractAddress: "",
			standardContractType: "",
			chain: "ethereum",
			method: "eth_getBalance",
			parameters: [":userAddress", "latest"],
			returnValueTest: {
				comparator: ">=",
				value: "0", // 0 ETH, so anyone can open
			},
		},
	];

	return accessControlConditions;
}
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	Using Lit Protocol, the access control conditions provide near infinite flexibility. Imagine a system for government
	bid management: bids are required to be submitted by a specific deadline, tracked using Irys' millisecond-accurate
	timestamps. The bids remain encrypted up to this deadline, aiding in preventing corruption by ensuring the bids are
	inaccessible to all parties until the designated time.
</Callout>

### Connecting to a Lit node

Write a helper function to connect to a Lit node:

```js
async function getLitNodeClient() {
	// Initialize LitNodeClient
	const litNodeClient = new LitJsSdk.LitNodeClientNodeJs({
		alertWhenUnauthorized: false,
		litNetwork: "cayenne",
	});
	await litNodeClient.connect();

	return litNodeClient;
}
```

### Encrypt data

Finally, write a function that accepts a string and uses the code we wrote earlier to encrypt it. In this guide we're using the Lit function [`encryptString()`](https://lit-js-sdk-v3-api-docs.vercel.app/functions/encryption_src.encryptString.html) which encrypts a string and returns both the encrypted string and a hash of the original string. Lit also [`encryptFile()`](https://lit-js-sdk-v3-api-docs.vercel.app/functions/encryption_src.encryptFile.html) for encrypting files directly.

```js
async function encryptData(dataToEncrypt) {
	const authSig = await getAuthSig();
	const accessControlConditions = getAccessControlConditions();
	const litNodeClient = await getLitNodeClient();

	// 1. Encryption
	// <Blob> encryptedString
	// <Uint8Array(32)> dataToEncryptHash
	const { ciphertext, dataToEncryptHash } = await LitJsSdk.encryptString(
		{
			authSig,
			accessControlConditions,
			dataToEncrypt: dataToEncrypt,
			chain: "ethereum",
		},
		litNodeClient,
	);
	return [ciphertext, dataToEncryptHash];
}
```

## Storing on Arweave via Irys

To use Irys to store data on Arweave, first connect to an [Irys node](/overview/nodes). This function uses the same private key from our `.env` file and connects to the Irys Devnet where uploads are stored for 60 days. In a production environment, you would change this to use Irys' [Node 1 or 2](/overview/nodes) instead where uploads are permanent.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	This code is configured to MATIC to pay for uploads, and while working with the Irys Devnet, you need to fund your
	wallet with [free MUMBAI MATIC Devnet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/) tokens. Alternatively, you could use [any other
	Devnet token](/overview/supported-tokens#devnet-tokens) supported by Irys.
</Callout>

```js
async function getIrys() {
	const url = "https://devnet.irys.xyz";
	const providerUrl = "https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com";
	const token = "matic";

	const irys = new Irys({
		url, // URL of the node you want to connect to
		token, // Token used for payment
		key: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY, // Private key
		config: { providerUrl }, // Optional provider URL, only required when using Devnet
	});
	return irys;
}
```

Then write a function that takes the encrypted data, the original data hash, the access control conditions, and stores it all on Arweave using Irys. Irys' upload function returns [a signed receipt](/learn/receipts) containing the exact time (in milliseconds) of the upload and also a transaction ID, which can then be used to [download the data from a gatway](/developer-docs/downloading).

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
	For simplicity, we'll consolidate all three values into a JSON object and upload it to Irys in one transaction. This
	is a design choice; you have the flexibility to store these values as you see fit in your own implementation.
</Callout>

```js
async function storeOnIrys(cipherText, dataToEncryptHash) {
	const irys = await getIrys();

	const dataToUpload = {
		cipherText: cipherText,
		dataToEncryptHash: dataToEncryptHash,
		accessControlConditions: getAccessControlConditions(),
	};

	let receipt;
	try {
		const tags = [{ name: "Content-Type", value: "application/json" }];
		receipt = await irys.upload(JSON.stringify(dataToUpload), { tags });
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
	}

	return receipt?.id;
}
```

## Decrypting data

<img
	className="border border-[#FEF4EE] rounded mt-5 md:w-5/6 w-full"
	src="/img/tutorials/encrypting/irys-lit-decrypting.png"
/>

There are three steps to decrypting data:

-   Obtain a wallet signature ([AuthSig](https://developer.litprotocol.com/v3/sdk/authentication/overview#obtain-an-authsig)), which proves you own a wallet
-   Retrieve data stored on Arweave
-   Connect to a Lit node and request that it decrypt your data

### Retrieving data from Arweve using the Irys gatway

To download data stored on Arweave, the easiest way is to connect to a [gateway](/overview/gateways) and request the data using your transaction ID. In this example, we'll use the Irys gateway.

This function downloads the data JSON object, parses out the three values and returns them as an array of strings.

```js
async function retrieveFromIrys(id) {
	const gatewayAddress = "https://gateway.irys.xyz/";
	const url = `${gatewayAddress}${id}`;

	try {
		const response = await fetch(url);

		if (!response.ok) {
			throw new Error(`Failed to retrieve data for ID: ${id}`);
		}

		const data = await response.json();
		return [data.cipherText, data.dataToEncryptHash, data.accessControlConditions];
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error retrieving data ", e);
	}
}
```

### Decrypting data

Finally, we decrypt the data using Lit's [`decryptString()`](https://lit-js-sdk-v3-api-docs.vercel.app/functions/encryption_src.encryptString.html) function.

```js
async function decryptData(ciphertext, dataToEncryptHash, accessControlConditions) {
	const authSig = await getAuthSig();
	const litNodeClient = await getLitNodeClient();

	let decryptedString;
	try {
		decryptedString = await LitJsSdk.decryptToString(
			{
				authSig,
				accessControlConditions,
				ciphertext,
				dataToEncryptHash,
				chain: "ethereum",
			},
			litNodeClient,
		);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log(e);
	}

	return decryptedString;
}
```

## Main function

Finally, write a `main()` function that calls the calls our encrypt, store and decrypt code.

```js
async function main() {
	const messageToEncrypt = "Irys + Lit is 🔥x2";

	// 1. Encrypt data
	const [cipherText, dataToEncryptHash] = await encryptData(messageToEncrypt);

	// 2. Store cipherText and dataToEncryptHash on Irys
	const encryptedDataID = await storeOnIrys(cipherText, dataToEncryptHash);

	console.log(`Data stored at https://gateway.irys.xyz/${encryptedDataID}`);

	// 3. Retrieve data stored on Irys
	// In real world applications, you could wait any amount of time before retrieving and decrypting
	const [cipherTextRetrieved, dataToEncryptHashRetrieved, accessControlConditions] = await retrieveFromIrys(
		encryptedDataID,
	);
	// 4. Decrypt data
	const decryptedString = await decryptData(cipherTextRetrieved, dataToEncryptHashRetrieved, accessControlConditions);
	console.log("decryptedString:", decryptedString);
}

main();
```
