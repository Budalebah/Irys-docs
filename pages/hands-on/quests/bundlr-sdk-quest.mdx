# Bundlr SDK Quest

Bundlr Developer Quests is a fun program designed to help you learn about the Bundlr suite of solutions and also about Web3 development in general.

Quest 1 is the first step in your journey to becoming a Buildoooor. In this quest, you'll learn about our SDK and how to add permanent decentralized storage to your dApp.

You'll learn how to:

-   Install the SDK
-   Upload a file to the permaweb
-   Upload a folder to the permaweb
-   Upload an entire static website to the permaweb

Once you complete Quest 1, we'll whitelist you for a unique NFT. This NFT is your Proof Of Knowledge, and it's your membership into a worldwide community of over 40,000 Questdoooors.
