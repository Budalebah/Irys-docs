# Irys SDK tutorial

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Irys with NodeJS to permanently store data.

## Prerequisites

To use this tutorial, you will need:

- A crypto wallet with a small amount of [Devnet tokens](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia)
- A recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/)
- A code editor ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or others)

## Installing

First, make sure you have Node installed:

```console
node -v
```

If you get a version number like "v16.14.0" back, you’re good to go. Otherwise, [install Node](<(https://nodejs.org/)>).

Next, create a new directory and cd into it.

```console
mkdir irys-basics
cd irys-basics
```

And then install the SDK
using npm:

```console
npm install @irys/sdk
```

or using yarn:

```console
yarn add @irys/sdk
```

When you use npm or yarn to install the SDK, it will create a file titled `package.json` in your root directory. Open up that file and add `"type" : "module"` to the beginning, allowing you to use ES6 module imports.

Finally, run the following in your command prompt to create a new JavaScript file, then fire up your code editor of choice.

```console
touch irys-basics.js
```

## dotenv

Install the free `dotenv` package. We will store our private key in a `.env` file and access it using the `dotenv` package.

```console
npm install dotenv
```

Now create a file called `.env` in your main directory:

```console
touch .env
```

And edit it to contain the private key of a wallet file that has been funded with free [Sepolia tokens](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/ethereum-sepolia).

```
ETH_PRIVATE_KEY=________
```

## Connecting to Irys

Start by connecting to Irys. In this example, we connect to the Irys devnet, which also requires you to pass an RPC URL. When connecting to [Irys' mainnet](/overview/networks), you don't need to supply an RPC address.

```js
const getIrys = async () => {
	const network = "devnet";
	// Devnet RPC URLs change often, use a recent one from https://chainlist.org/
	const providerUrl = "";
	const token = "ethereum";

	const irys = new Irys({
		network, // "mainnet" || "devnet"
		token, // Token used for payment
		key: process.env.ETH_PRIVATE_KEY, // Private key
		config: { providerUrl }, // Optional provider URL, only required when using Devnet
	});
	return irys;
	console.log(`wallet address = ${irys.address}`);
};
await getIrys();
```

Paste the above code into the `irys-basics.js` file you created and then run it by typing:

```console
 node irys-basics.js
```

from your CLI, if it successfully prints your wallet address, you’re good to go.

## Funding a node

To fund a node, pass the amount you want to fund in atomic units. Assuming you setup Irys to use Mumbai Matic, the following will fund 0.5 MATIC:

```js
const fundNode = async () => {
	const irys = await getIrys();
	try {
		const fundTx = await irys.fund(irys.utils.toAtomic(0.5));
		console.log(`Successfully funded ${irys.utils.fromAtomic(fundTx.quantity)} ${irys.token}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
	}
};
await fundNode();
```

Paste the above code into `irys-basics.js` and run as you did before.

## Checking upload price

You can check the cost to upload data by passing a number of bytes to the function `irys.getPrice()`. This code checks the cost to upload 1 Megabyte (1048576 bytes).

```js
const checkPrice = async () => {
	const irys = await getIrys();

	const numBytes = 1048576; // Number of bytes to check
	const priceAtomic = await irys.getPrice(numBytes);

	// Convert from atomic units to standard units
	const priceConverted = irys.utils.fromAtomic(numBytes);

	console.log(`Uploading ${numBytes} bytes costs ${priceConverted}`);
};
await checkPrice();
```

## Uploading data

If it can be reduced to 1s and 0s, it can be uploaded to Arweave via Irys using the function `irys.upload()`, as with this example that uploads the string "GM world."

```js
const uploadData = async () => {
	const irys = await getIrys();
	const dataToUpload = "GM world.";
	try {
		const receipt = await irys.upload(dataToUpload);
		console.log(`Data uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading data ", e);
	}
};
await uploadData();
```

## Uploading a file

You can upload a file by passing its name to the function `irys.uploadFile()`. To run this code, find a PNG file on your local drive, rename it to `myImage.png` and place it in the same directory as the `irys-basics.js` file.

```js
const uploadFile = async () => {
	const irys = await getIrys();
	// Your file
	const fileToUpload = "./myImage.png";

	const tags = [{ name: "application-id", value: "MyNFTDrop" }];

	try {
		const receipt = await irys.uploadFile(fileToUpload, { tags: tags });
		console.log(`File uploaded ==> https://gateway.irys.xyz/${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
	}
};

await uploadFile();
```

## Uploading a folder

You can also upload an entire folder of images with a single line of code. To run this example, create a directory in the same folder as `irys-basics.js` and fill it with image files.

```js
const uploadFolder = async () => {
	const irys = await getIrys();

	// Upload an entire folder
	const folderToUpload = "./my-images/"; // Path to folder
	try {
		const receipt = await irys.uploadFolder("./" + folderToUpload, {
			indexFile: "", // optional index file (file the user will load when accessing the manifest)
			batchSize: 50, //number of items to upload at once
			keepDeleted: false, // whether to keep now deleted items from previous uploads
		}); //returns the manifest ID

		console.log(`Files uploaded. Manifest Id ${receipt.id}`);
	} catch (e) {
		console.log("Error uploading file ", e);
	}
};
await uploadFolder();
```

Files uploaded via `irys.uploadFolder(folderToUpload)` can be retrieved in one of two ways.

1. Creating a URL with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/[manifest-id]/[original-file-name]`.
2. Creating a URL using the transaction ID of each individual file uploaded with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz/[transacton-id]`

After a successful folder upload, two files are written to your local project directory `[folder-name].csv` and `[folder-name].json`. The example below highlights a folder called “llama_folder” with a total of 5 files in it. The transaction id for each file can be used to retrieve the uploaded data by forming a URL with the format `https://gateway.irys.xyz]/[transaction-id]`

<img
	className="border border-[#FEF4EE] rounded-xl mt-5 md:w-5/6 w-full"
	src="/img/code-assets/llama-folder-manifest.png"
/>

## Uploading a static website

You can also use the SDK to [uplaod an entire static website to the permaweb](/tutorials/uploading-static-sites).
